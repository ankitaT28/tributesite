          <p>Have the courage to follow your Heart and Intuition.</p>
          <p>"Steven Paul Jobs was born on February 24, 1955."</p>
          <p>Jobs's design aesthetic was influenced by philosophies of Zen and Buddhism.</p>
          <p>In India, he experienced Buddhism while on his seven-month spiritual journey, and
		  his sense of intuition was influenced by the spiritual people with whom he studied.</p>
          <p>Although entirely designed by Steve Wozniak, Jobs had the idea of selling the desktop computer, 
		  which led to the formation of Apple Computer in 1976.</p>
          <p>“Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice."</p>
          <p>“The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.”</p>
      
          <p>Scott McNealy, one of the cofounders of Sun Microsystems, said that Jobs broke a "Glass Age Ceiling" in Silicon Valley 
		  because he'd created a very successful company at a young age.</p>
          
          <p>Apple iMac G3 was introduced in 1998 and its innovative design was directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple.</p>
          <p>iTunes is a media player, media library, online radio broadcaster,
		  and mobile device management application developed by Apple.</p>
          <p>Apple began work on the first iPhone in 2005 and the first iPhone was released on June 29, 2007.</p>
          <p>“If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.”</p>
          
          <p>Jobs died at his Palo Alto, California home on October 5, 2011.</p>
